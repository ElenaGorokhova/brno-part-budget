# brno-part-budget
This repository aims to provide data for visualisation of projects submitted to [Participatory Budget in Brno, Czech Rep](https://damenavas.brno.cz/).

To do that the script:
* Downloads data about participatory budget projects from API
* Scrapes data about public votes from a webpage
* Pushes the resulting dataset into a Google spreadsheet

Hosting and scheduling of the script is managed via [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and final visualisation is performed via [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/).
